These programs were part of an andvanced numerical methods course at the technical university of Graz. 

Three different programs were done (description in german, copied from Prof. Sormann, explanations in the source directories):


1) Computertomographie

2) Numerische Auswertung gewisser partieller Differentialgleichungen mittels der Methode der Finiten Elemente.

3) Stiff Differential Equations
